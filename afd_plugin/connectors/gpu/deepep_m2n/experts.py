"""MoE FFN on DeepEP-received rows: this FFN rank's local experts only.

DeepEP's expanded dispatch hands the FFN rank one row per (token, local
expert) pair, grouped per expert with each group starting at a multiple of
``expert_alignment``, plus one top-k weight per row. The executor returns
``weight * expert(row)`` in BF16 for every row in the received shape; DeepEP's
combine then sums each token's rows back on its Attention rank. Padding rows
between expert groups are never read by combine, so their content is
irrelevant.

Payloads:

- BF16 rows with BF16 weights.
- FP8 rows (per-row, per-128-channel fp32 scales) with FP8 block-128 weights
  (vLLM's block-FP8 ``FusedMoE`` layout).

Backends:

- ``deepgemm``: FastAFD's path. DeepGEMM grouped GEMMs consume DeepEP's
  per-expert prefix sum directly (no re-permutation). BF16: GEMM, vLLM
  ``silu_and_mul``, GEMM, weight multiply. FP8: GEMM, fused SiLU-mul with the
  top-k weight folded in and FP8 requant (``fp8_quant.py``), GEMM. Requires
  ``expert_alignment`` equal to the DeepGEMM contiguous-layout M alignment.
- ``fused_experts``: vLLM's Triton ``fused_experts`` with ``top_k=1`` on the
  valid rows (FP8 inputs and weights are dequantized to BF16 first). Reads the
  prefix sum on the host: a correctness reference, not a fast path.
