# AFD Recipes

This directory contains deployment and benchmark recipes for AFD connectors.
Read each recipe's support status before running it: some historical experiment
records are retained for provenance but are not supported by the current
runtime. Both GPU and Ascend target vLLM 0.32. The
[Ascend validation record](https://github.com/vllm-project/afd-plugin/pull/507) links the tested
scope; the V3.2 recipes below retain their historical versions.

## Directory layout

Recipes are organized by hardware backend, connector, and model:

```text
recipe/
├── gpu/
│   ├── DeepEPM2NAFDConnector/
│   │   ├── qwen3_235b_a22b_fp8/
│   │   └── qwen3_30b_a3b/
│   └── P2pNcclAFDConnector/
│       └── deepseek_v2_lite/
└── npu/
    ├── CAMAsyncAFDConnector/
    │   └── deepseek_v3_2/
    └── CAMP2pAFDConnector/
        └── deepseek_v3_2/
```

Directory names follow these conventions:

- Hardware backend: `gpu` or `npu`.
- Connector: the exact connector class name, such as `P2pNcclAFDConnector`,
  `DeepEPM2NAFDConnector`, `CAMP2pAFDConnector`, or `CAMAsyncAFDConnector`.
- Model: the model family or variant in lowercase snake case, such as
  `deepseek_v2_lite` or `deepseek_v3_2`.

## Available recipes

| Hardware | Connector | Model | Recommended stage | Status | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GPU | `P2pNcclAFDConnector` | DeepSeek-V2-Lite | Decode | Deployment examples; see the linked README for validation scope | [Launch examples](gpu/P2pNcclAFDConnector/deepseek_v2_lite/README.md) |
| GPU (SM90+) | `DeepEPM2NAFDConnector` | Qwen3-30B-A3B | Decode | Same 2A2F layouts as the Qwen3 MoE DeepEP M2N E2E cases | [Launch examples](gpu/DeepEPM2NAFDConnector/qwen3_30b_a3b/README.md) |
| GPU (SM90+) | `DeepEPM2NAFDConnector` | Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP8 | Decode | 4A2F FP8-payload configuration run on H200 | [Launch examples](gpu/DeepEPM2NAFDConnector/qwen3_235b_a22b_fp8/README.md) |
| Ascend NPU | `CAMP2pAFDConnector` | DeepSeek-V3.2 | Decode | Historical v0.19.1rc1 recipe; not qualified for the 0.32 target | [Synchronous decode](npu/CAMP2pAFDConnector/deepseek_v3_2/README.md) |
| Ascend NPU | `CAMAsyncAFDConnector` | DeepSeek-V3.2 | Prefill / decode | Historical v0.19.1rc1/v0.26 recipes, not qualified for 0.32; v0.26 DP2TP8+EP16 token split reached `0.9522` strict match; legacy PCP8 results are v0.19-only | [Async CAM](npu/CAMAsyncAFDConnector/deepseek_v3_2/README.md) |

Open the model-level README before running a recipe. It documents the required
hardware and runtime baseline, topology, environment variables, launch order,
support status, and known limitations. Unless a recipe says otherwise, run its
commands from the repository root.

## Adding a recipe

Add new content under `recipe/<hardware>/<connector>/<model>/`. Each model
directory should contain a `README.md` describing prerequisites, topology,
launch commands, validation steps, and limitations. Keep model-specific launch
scripts, configuration files, and result images in the same directory so the
recipe can be moved or linked as one unit.
